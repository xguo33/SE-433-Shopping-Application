# SE-433-Shopping-Application
This is a simple shopping application 
We can add/remove items, see each item's details, 
chose delivery method(stander and nextday), add tax to special states
...

This project has very nice code test resulet.
We achieve 100% path coverage and also use pit tests to make our test more efficiency!

That's my first complete project.
Base on this, I learn how I can create an project and test this project.

Co-writer is XuWei Lin.
